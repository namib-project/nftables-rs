#                                  
#   Netfilter's NFTable firewall   
#                                  
# This is just a ruleset to play around with the syntax introduced
# in nftables and itis my way of getting to know it.
#
# Here might be dragons!
#
# To invoke:
#
#   $ sudo iptable-save > iptables.backup
#   $ sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
#   $ sudo iptables -F
#   $ sudo iptables -X
#   $ sudo nft flush ruleset && sudo nft -f nftables-init.rules
#
# To get back to your iptables ruleset:
#
#  $ sudo nft flush ruleset
#  $ sudo iptables-restore < iptables.backup
#
#  BEWARE: during the above commands there is a short moment where 
#          there are no firewall rules active. That is why the default
#          policy is changed to drop all traffic. But still you 
#          should make sure to only try this on trusted networks!
