//! nftables-rs is a Rust library designed to provide a safe and easy-to-use abstraction over the nftables JSON API, known as libnftables-json.
//!
//! This library is engineered for developers who need to interact with nftables,
//! the Linux kernel's next-generation firewalling tool, directly from Rust applications.
//!
//! By abstracting the underlying JSON API, nftables-rs facilitates the creation, manipulation,
//! and application of firewall rulesets without requiring deep knowledge of nftables' internal workings.
